# CFD_Navier-Stokes
Assignment:

"In this project you are to make a simple Navier Stokes solver. The solver should calculate the flow in a cavity.
...
To help you in the start, you have access to a matlab code : sola.m. There exist also a youtube video describing the sola code.
...
In addition to calculation of flow in the cavity, the flow around a square/rectangel should be calculated along with the forces. To find the forces we simply integrate the pressure around the body."
